# Ginger Strategic Research

This is my first client as the responsible developer, which means handling 100% of the code without the help of anyone but the internet itself.

The project started initially just to code the animated background, having a static PSD layout provided by a designer. Using some basic level skills in Adobe Illustrator, I turned the 'amoeba' shape into an SVG object, extracting this code to be handled into a JSON file, loaded into the DOM by some few lines of vanilla JS. After all these elements are animated in an infinite and not sync commands, mostly 'transform' properties, kind of creating a relaxing fluid background.

The client really liked the result and asked my help to finish the whole project. At this moment it sounded as a really easy task, with a short PPT with all small adjustments that they needed. But actually we realized the website wasn't running smoothly, but showing some annoying issues like breaking points in the responsiveness, depending on the user's screen. Then I understood that I should restart the whole thing from the scratch.

A few weeks after publishing the website, the client also asked to provide a double-language structure. So they sent me the translation itself and I turned the HTML pages into PHP pages, in order to aply a php method to code the multi-language feature. Despite being a begginer in PHP, I could accomplish this multi-language task in just 16 hours, which made me proud.
