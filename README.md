# Ginger Strategic Research

This is my first client as the responsible developer, which means handling 100% of the code without the help of anyone but the internet itself.

The project started initially just to code the animated background, having a static PSD layout provided by a designer. Using some basic level skills in Adobe Illustrator, I turned the 'amoeba' shape into an SVG object, extracting this code to be handled into a JSON file, loaded into the DOM by some few lines of vanilla JS. After all these elements are animated in an infinite and not sync commands, mostly 'transform' properties, kind of creating a relaxing fluid background.

The client really liked the result and, somehow, decided to ask my help to finish the whole project. At this moment it sounded as a really easy task, with a short PPT with all small adjustments that they needed. But actually we realized the website wasn't running smoothly, but showing some annoying issues with the responsiveness and cracking in some devices. Then I understood that I should restart the whole thing, from the scratch.

Soon, this repo will be hosting the second phase of the project, which will turn this Brazilian website into a double-language website.
